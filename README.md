# Theme Switching using Styled Components in ReactJs.

This is the code example for my article on [Build a React theme switcher app with styled-components](https://blog.logrocket.com/build-react-theme-switcher-app-styled-components/) for [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com). Here is the [live demo](https://theme-switching.vercel.app).

## Outline
Using the ThemeProvider, a wrapper component available in styled-components, we can quickly set up multiple custom themes in React and switch between them with ease.

To demonstrate this, we’ll build a React app featuring quotes from popular characters from Game of Thrones. This tutorial will show how to create styled components and multiple themes for the app, change the theme with a click of a button, and save the theme in local storage.
