## Summary
Using the ThemeProvider, a wrapper component available in styled-components, we can quickly set up multiple custom themes in React and switch between them with ease.

To demonstrate this, we’ll build a React app featuring quotes from popular characters from Game of Thrones. This tutorial will show how to create styled components and multiple themes for the app, change the theme with a click of a button, and save the theme in local storage.
